# Dofus chasse helper

A tool for Dofus Unity for Windows that will try to understand the current state of the Hunt on dofus and fill out the form from DofusPourLesNoobs website

It's not perfect, and a lot of things could be improve, but it's also kinda working in some cases.  
To make the most out of it, I recommend you to set the interface size in the accessibility option to 120%. It seems like it was working a lot better with that option.

And also, it will only work with the game language in french, since it's looking for french text on the screen to determine where are the elements. It's not ideal but that was pretty easy and quick to do.

## Todo list

- Fix the issue where some folders needs to be created in C:\
- Share all arrow templates, otherwise the app will not work
- Add an option file to edit the shortcuts
- Improve the detection
